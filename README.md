## 🌍 Deep Impact: Machine Learning–Powered Asteroid Collision Risk Analyser

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an asteroid being classified as potentially hazardous to Earth. Using real-world data from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) API, the model analyzes key orbital and physical parameters such as relative velocity, estimated diameter, miss distance, and orbital eccentricity to assess risk levels.

### 📊 Technologies & Tools

- **Python**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy**: for data handling
- **Scikit-learn**: for machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **Matplotlib**: for data visualisation
- **Streamlit**: for building an interactive dashboard
- **NASA NEO API**: for real-time and historical asteroid data
