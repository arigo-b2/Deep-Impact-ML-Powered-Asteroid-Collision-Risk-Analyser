## 🌍 Deep Impact: Machine Learning–Powered Asteroid Collision Risk Analyzer

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an asteroid being classified as potentially hazardous to Earth. Using real-world data from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) API, the model analyzes key orbital and physical parameters such as relative velocity, estimated diameter, miss distance, and orbital eccentricity to assess risk levels.
